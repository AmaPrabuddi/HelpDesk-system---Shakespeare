<h2>About Our Shakespeare University</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1998, the University of Shakespeare is an educational institution of international stature. This university is a member of U.G.C . Today, the University of Shakespeare consistently ranks in the top tier of national research universities as they seek to broaden knowledge in science and the humanities.

        University of Shakespeare website is a prime example of a powerful yet simple design. It effectively showcases elements such as:
        
        Straightforward navigation: The navigation bar guides users to important content and is divided into a handful of categories based on the type of user (i.e. visitor, prospective student, current student, and faculty & staff) and areas of interest (‘About’ and ‘Research’). Plus, there’s a search tool to help users find any other information they might need.
        White space: While content is certainly important, this college website limits copy and visuals to embrace negative space. This strategy effectively emphasizes the actions they want visitors to take, such as applying and donating.
        The University of Shakespeare website stands out from other colleges and effectively displays the school’s prominence within the higher ed space. Instead of cramming a ton of visuals and text into a small space, their simple design gives users space to breathe. Ultimately, the design elements come together to create a cohesive, positive user experience.
